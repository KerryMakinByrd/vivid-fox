She said that the thing that bothered her is that the last time she said goodbye she didn’t know it would be the last time. I understood that.
This week I walked my daughter to school, a rarer experience in the last few weeks. I used to walk her to school every day. When she was six and seven, we’d hold hands. When she was eight and nine she told me animated stories, yelling, ‘I love you’ as we said goodbye. Now she’s almost 13, taller than me and hedging toward preferring a solo journey so she can talk to neighbor kids or listen to music. But this Wednesday was special. 
And even more rare, I had the fleeting awareness, like a whir of a swift bird over my head. I inhaled the colors, the sounds, the weight of her next to me, realizing this might be the very last time.

There are so many moments in life that we don’t know will be the last time. I’m not going to give you some line about savoring every moment. I think we’re too flooded to do that; we’re managing a deluge of information and experience all waking moments. 

BUT that walk. That walk was honey sweet.

More reading: I just finished Penunmbra's 24 Hour Bookstore. It's the first fiction book I've enjoyed in too long. It was like a quiet welcoming back to the joy of reading. It's a book where the twist is a slow calming smile, a moment where you feel known and loved. So I dug deeper to find who this gorgeous writer was and discovered he made this teeny app which is really a simple essay and a meditation on life. I highly recommend you spent 5 minutes on it. https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/
